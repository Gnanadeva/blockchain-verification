# Academic Certificates on the Blockchain

The academic certificate verification platform using blockchain technology is used to issue, manage and verify academic certificates in a secure and distributed manner. This project addresses the need for a secure digital platform to issue and verify academic certificates without intervention from the original certificate issuer (University).



The users of the platform include - Universities, Students and Certificate Verifiers (Eg - Employers). The actions that can be performed by each party are as follows

**Universities**
* Issue academic certificates.
* View academic certificates issued. 
* Endorse Verification and digitally sign academic certificates.

**Students**
* Receive academic certificates from universities.
* View and manage received academic certificates.
* Share academic certificates with third party verifiers.
* Selective disclosure of certificate data.

**Verifier**
* Receive certificate data from students.
* Verify certificate authenticity with blockchain platform.
